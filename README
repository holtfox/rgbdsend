rgbdsend


1 Introduction

rgbdsend is a program to capture short sequences of RGBD data from an OpenNI2
compliant sensor, convert them to a point cloud and send them to a remote server.



2 Building

rgbdsend requires libcurl and OpenNI2. Install the dependencies and follow
these steps to build it:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ . /path/to/OpenNI/OpenNIDevEnvironment
$ cmake ..
$ make

This will create the rgbdsend executable in your current directory. To read the
destination server information, rgbdsend needs a config file in the same
directory as the executable. An example file is included with the source.

$ mv ../config.example config



3 Config File Format

The Config file format is ini-style. Lines beginning with # and empty lines are
ignored.

The other lines may contain either a section declaration (3.1) or a key/value
pair (3.2).

See config.cpp and config.example for possible options.


3.1 Sections

A section declaration has the form
	
	[Section]
	
Where "Section" is the section name. A section declaration initiates a section.
A section ends when a new section is initiated or the file ends. Every section
defines a set of keys and values.


3.2 Key/value pairs

A key/value pair has the form

	key value

where "key" is the name of the config option seperated by a single space from
"value" which is the value of that option. A key/value pair may only appear
inside a Section it is defined in. There may be no key/value pairs without a
section.
