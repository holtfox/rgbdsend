rgbdsend


1. Introduction

rgbdsend is a program to capture short sequences of RGBD data from an OpenNI2
compliant sensor and send them to a remote server.

2. Building

rgbdsend requires libcurl and OpenNI2. Install the dependencies and follow
these steps to build it:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ . /path/to/OpenNI/OpenNIDevEnvironment
$ cmake ..
$ make

This will create the rgbdsend executable in your current directory. To read the
destination server information, rgbdsend needs a config file in the same
directory as the executable. An example file is included with the source.

$ mv ../config.example config

3. Config File Format

The Config file format is very simple. Lines beginning with # and empty lines
are ignored. The other lines contain the configuration data in the following
order:

URL
Username
Password
Capture Time [ms]
